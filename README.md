## About Me

## AI Researcher with a Focus on Media, 3D and Interdisciplinary Applications

I am currently studying for an MSc in Artificial Intelligence for Media, building on a background in architectural design and film production. My work explores how AI, computer vision, and 3D technologies can be applied across both creative and technical contexts, from visual storytelling to interactive systems.

While I have a particular interest in media technology, game development, and creative uses of AI, I am equally open to applying my technical skills in other domains where innovative thinking and cross-disciplinary collaboration are valued.
