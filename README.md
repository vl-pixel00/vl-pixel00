## About Me

## AI/ML Graduate

MSc Artificial Intelligence for Media (2025). I build **small, reliable** AI systems for constrained/regulated settings that run **offline/on-device** when needed, produce **auditable outputs**, use **clear metrics**, and have **reproducible runs**. I like to take a scoped problem, ship a first version quickly, then harden it with tests, validation, and documentation.

## Technical Skills

- **Programming & Stack:** Python; PyTorch, MLX; NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn; OpenCV  
- **ML:** training & evaluation (accuracy/F1; latency/size); experiment design; reproducible configs/seeds; classification and clustering  
- **LLMs:** fine-tuning; parameter-efficient methods; task adaptation; schema/JSON validation  
- **CV & 3D:** detection/classification; image processing; 3D reconstruction/multi-view  
- **NLP:** text classification; NER; event extraction; clean preprocessing pipelines  
- **Data:** curation/labelling; preprocessing/cleaning; feature engineering; data loaders  
- **Engineering:** logging/monitoring; packaging/versioning; reproducible runs; docs/reporting  
- **Simulation:** Unity for AV/simulation  
- **Foundations:** linear algebra; probability & statistics; optimisation  
- **Learning:** production Python practices; FastAPI; AWS Certified AI Practitioner (in progress)

## Other Skills

- **Creative Tools:** Adobe Creative Suite for media processing and visualisation; design workflows

## Research Interests

- On-device/offline AI for decision support in constrained environments
- Robust evaluation & reproducibility (audit logs, versioned artefacts)
- CV for situational awareness; 3D/simulation testbeds for perception
- Applied GenAI/NLP for structured extraction and data integration
- Cross-domain work in defence, public sector, and health

*Practical AI that others can run, test, and trust.*
